                        <p class="text-faded">Web development is an ever expanding field, that I am excited to say I am a part of. I have finished
                            my degree at K-State Polytechnic where I have been studying Java, PHP, CSS3, HTML5, and C#. I
                            have used different IDE’s such as Eclipse, JGrasp, Brackets,Dreamweaver, and Microsoft Visual
                            Studio. The framework I use for web design is Bootstrap.
                            <br> I believe in putting everything I am into everything I do.
                            <br>
                            <br> I have been learning GIT, in my spare time to further my learning experience in version
                            control, as well as JavaScript. I am reliable, dependable, and always willing to learn new things.
                            <br>
                            <br> I have done multiple small projects such as a “stat finder” website that uses the JSON API
                            to retrieve stats from a video game site and relay it on my site, from another version of that
                            stat finder site using C#/.NET built in MVC framework.
                            <br>
                            <br> I worked on a final group project for Kansas State Polytechnic that will revamp their current
                            system. We worked in groups to create a CRM system to keep track of their students, organize
                            their database, and track all of their data. I also have experience in design and have worked
                            with Photoshop, In-design, and Illustrator.
                            <br>
                            <br> I enjoy art and photography as a hobby.</p>

                                <p>This website was a final project for PHP. www.Battlefield4stats.com allows you to use their API to retrieve stats.
                                    I used this to allow a user to search for a player by name and platform type, once both are selected a GET request is made, which the
                                    username and platform is replaced in a bf4.com stats url, to get the stats. If the user is found, I display information by echoing
                                    out the stats using the battlefield 4 stat API in JSON and show the results in tables.
